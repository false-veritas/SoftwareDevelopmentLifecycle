# SoftwareDevelopmentLifecycle

## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs is a large part of software development and must be focused on throughout the development lifecycle because it is the targeted audience. When stakeholders want to 
create a project and they come to the Scrum Team for development, their requests are turned into user stories. These user stories are broken down further for the Development Team 
to create what the user stories are requesting. The user stories can be considered a kind of loose roadmap for the Development Team. The stakeholders may have some ideas but the 
Product Owner takes those ideas, forms user stories with the end users in mind and gives these stories for the Development Team.

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs we must start at what we want to create and take that idea and break it down further into what we expect to have along the way. In an agile method, not 
everything is set it stone so we must consider that changes can be made along the way where needed. I believe the best agile processes to use are the Sprints and undertaking as 
many stories as possible to complete during that Sprint. What makes Agile great is testing as you go. You create something during the Sprint and you test it while you create it so 
that by the end of the Sprint you know it works. A lot of companies create to code then test at the end. This ends with a lot of going back to fix things that could have already 
been done. 

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development is understanding that not everyone may be as good as everyone else and that it is important to be available to your team as much 
as you can. When something needs to be changed, it's important to be able to help others create that change if they need help with it, but to not forget of one's own work. 
Learning from others is just as important as teaching someone what you know. Being patient and understanding can go a long way in software development.
